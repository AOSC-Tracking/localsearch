INTORDUCTION

Tracker is a powerful metadata framework that provides the ability to store, retrieve and search all types of file metadata including user defined ones.

Tracker's features include:

* Implements the freedesktop specification for metadata http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Standards_2fshared_2dfilemetadata_2dspec

* Extracts embedded File, Image, Document and Audio type metadata from files.

* Supports the WC3's RDF Query syntax for querying metadata

* Provides support for both free text search (like Beagle/Google) as well as structured searches using RDF Query

* Respond in real time to file system changes to keep its metadata database up to date and in synch

* Fully extendable with custom metadata - you can store, retrieve, register and search via RDF Query all your own custom metadata

* Can extract a file's contents as plain text and index them

* Can provide thumbnailing on the fly



INSTALLATION (from source):

You will need to make sure you have the following dependencies installed : 

libmysqld.a (version 4.1 or higher) - this is the embedded mysql server lib found in Debian package libmysqlclientXX-dev. RPMs (look for embedded server) can be found at : http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/4.1.html

libdbus (0.50 +)

dbus-glib bndings (0.50 +)

glib (2.6+)

zlib

libvorbisfile3 (1.1+) 



To compile Tracker uses the following commands :

./configure --prefix=/usr
make
sudo make install

If you install using any other prefix then you might have problems with files not being installed correctly.

(You may need to copy the dbus service file to the correct directory and/or might need to update ldconf if you install into non standard directories.)




RUNNING TRACKER

If installed correctly, the tracker daemon (trackerd) can be started automatically via Dbus activation.

On the first run, Tracker will automatically create a new database and start populating it with metadata by browsing through the user's home directory.

On subsequent runs, Tracker will start up much much faster and will only ever incrementally index files (IE files that have changed since last index).



COMMAND LINE TOOLS

Tracker comes with a number of command line apps that you can use:

"tracker-extract FILE" - this extracts embedded metadata from FILE and prints to stdout

"tracker-search SEARCHTERM" - this perfoms a google like search using SEARCHTERM to retrieve all matching files where SEARCHTERM appears in any searchable metadata

"tracker-query" - this reads from STDIN an RDF Query that specifies the search criteria for various fields. It prints to STDOUT all matching files.
