This is all written in portable ANSI C with no additional
required libraries or dependencies. Thus, no configuration
is necessary and installing is as simple as:

make install

Or, to save a few kb on the already small binaries:

make strip install

And to uninstall:

make uninstall

To put the files somewhere other than /usr/local, change the PREFIX:

make install PREFIX=/opt
