.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-?, \-\-help
Show summary of options.
.TP
.B \-k, \-\-kill
This uses SIGKILL to stop all Tracker processes found. This is not
advised unless you are having problems stopping Tracker in the first
place. This 
.B GUARANTEES
death.
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-terminate
This uses SIGTERM to stop all Tracker processes found. This is
recommended over \-\-kill because it gives the processes time to
shutdown cleanly.
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-soft-reset
A soft reset works exactly the same way that 
.B \-\-hard-reset 
does, with the exception that the backup and journal are not removed.
These are restored when 
.B tracker-store
is restarted.

.TP
.B \-h, \-\-hard-reset
This kills all processes in the same way that 
.B \-\-kill
does but it also removes all databases. Restarting 
.B tracker-store
re-creates the databases.

.SH SEE ALSO
.BR tracker-store (1).
