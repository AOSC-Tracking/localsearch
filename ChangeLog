	* Migrated embedded database to mysql 5
	* Removed all parameterized queries and replaced with stored procedures
	* New stored procedures to encapsulate DB functionality and remove most DB logic from application
	* Simplified C code when interfacing with DB
	* Added support for parsing dates in various formats including conversion to/from ISO 8601 format
	* Fixed MsWord filter to prevent looping (WvText causes inotify to report file write change causing endless looping)
	* Redesigned DB structure to be more generic and service orientated
	* Added support for service types (first class objects) to DB
	* Renamed tables to be more service orientated
	* Added DB versioning data to DB so future DB changes can be implemented painlessly (and without requiring a rebuild of all indexed data)

2006-01-11  Jamie McCracken <jamiemcc@gnome.org>

	* Improved file change handling by creating a pending file
	  queue and a pending File Database table. This allows changes 
	  awaiting processing by the tracker daemon to be handled much
	  more efficiently with respect to memory usage.


2006-01-06  Jamie McCracken <jamiemcc@gnome.org>

	* Added fallback polling mechanism to trackerd.c. This kicks
	  in if iNotify/FAM is not available (IE if home directory
	  is on an NFS mount) or if iNotify/FAM watch limits have
	  been exceeded.
