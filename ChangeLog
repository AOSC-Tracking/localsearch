	* Updated libtracker to be more usable especially for Nautilus search


2006-01-11  Jamie McCracken <jamiemcc@gnome.org>

	* Improved file change handling by creating a pending file
	  queue and a pending File Database table. This allows changes 
	  awaiting processing by the tracker daemon to be handled much
	  more efficiently with respect to memory usage.


2006-01-06  Jamie McCracken <jamiemcc@gnome.org>

	* Added fallback polling mechanism to trackerd.c. This kicks
	  in if iNotify/FAM is not available (IE if home directory
	  is on an NFS mount) or if iNotify/FAM watch limits have
	  been exceeded.

2005-09-15 Jamie McCracken <jamiemcc@gnome.org>
